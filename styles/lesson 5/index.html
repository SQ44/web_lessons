        Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit
         formatting based on information that is not contained 
         in the document tree. One example of a widely used 
         pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only 
         when the user "points to" the visible element, usually 
         by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to 
         a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A pseudo-class
          classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, 
          whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist 
          of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.
          [6]

        Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specific
        ity and flexibility.[7] Multiple selectors may be joined in a 
        spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, 
        css, or any combination
